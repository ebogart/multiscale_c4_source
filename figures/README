To redraw the figures, copy the output of the fitting calculations
(gradient_fit.py, fit_zero_scales.pickle, fit_fixed_biomass.pickle,
fit_eflux.pickle, fit_eflux_fixed.pickle, key_fva_broad.pickle,
figure2_data.pickle) to this directory; then run figures.py)

Note that the autoradiograph panel of figure 3 must be edited in
manually.

Data in proteomics/mRNA_proteomics.pickle is from Ponnala, L., et al,
