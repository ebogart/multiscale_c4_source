# The subreactions of RXN-13191, absent from the FBA model, are in the
# chlorophyllide a biosynthesis pathway but it itself is not (note it
# shares gene annotations with them all.)  
RXN-13191

# Similarly, the subreactions of histidinol dehydrogenase are in the 
# histidine biosynthesis pathway (and not the FBA model) 
# but it itself is not in the pathway; again, all three have the same
# gene annotations, so leave it in place
RXN-8001

# Similar subreaction vs. composite reaction issues
# occur in leucine biosynthesis, where these reactions' subreactions
# are officially included in the pathway

# Two alternate pathways for synthesis of 
# chlorophyll A from chlorophyllide A are included 
# in CornCyc; each requires three reactions without assigned
# genes, so the choice between them is arbitrary. Minor 
# changes to the removal script may change how the optimization
# process makes this arbitrary choice. To eliminate that sensitivity,
# we specify that both branches should be kept.

# Based on analysis and prior testing, we accept that the following

# their use, because we do not want the optimization process to
# introduce other, potentially less plausible reactions into the model
# in an effort to avoid these.
