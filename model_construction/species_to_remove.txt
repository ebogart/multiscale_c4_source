# UDP-alpha-D-glucose, CDP-12575, is the only child of 
# UDP-glucose, and in nearly every case, the instantiated reactions
# CPD-12575 participates in are present alongside the non-instantiated
# forms (acting on UDP-D-glucose.) This adds complexity to the model and
# degeneracy to the space of good solutions without really telling us anything
# useful, so we remove all the CPD-12575 reactions. A few are 
# added back, acting on UDP-D-glucose, in special_cases.txt
CPD-12575

# Drop reactions with overly generic electron acceptor/donor pair
# (see writeup.tex for how some of these were modified and retained)
