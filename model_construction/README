These data files and scripts serve to produce a functional FBA model from CornCyc.

ptools_fba_problem/corn_simple.fba is a (trivial) Pathway Tools FBA model specification,
setting up a problem including all metabolic reactions from CornCyc.

Solving it with the Pathway Tools FBA model yields
ptools_fba_problem/corn_simple.sol, which lists the stoichiometries of
all reactions used in the FBA calculation (both those that carried
flux and those that did not.)  This list of stoichiometries is an
ideal starting point for further model-building as it excludes
unbalanced reactions, etc., while including instantiated forms of
reactions involving compound classes as substrates.

extract_from_ptools.sh calls additional Python scripts to process
corn_simple.sol, extracting and summarizing reaction information from
it and translating the reactants from their names (e.g., 'D-ribose
5-phosphate') to their Pathway Tools frames (e.g., 'RIBOSE-5P') to
avoid ambiguity and allow easy comparison to older models written in
terms of frames.  This script requires a running Pathway Tools
instance, the pycyc package, and a local copy of CornCyc. It produces: 
    - corn_table.txt, a table of reactions;
    - corn_exclusions.txt, a log of reactions in corn_simple.sol excluded 
      from corn_table.txt for one reason or another
    - gene_to_corncyc_reaction_indirect.txt, 
      gene_to_corncyc_reaction_direct.txt,
      corncyc_global_gra.txt: tables of (gene, reaction) pairs supported by the 
      database
    - corn_name_hints.txt, the common name of each species and
      reaction in the database, for use as their name in a later SBML
      version.

build_model.sh handles the remaining steps in the model 
assembly process, most of which do not require direct interaction 
with Pathway Tools. It:
    - Adds reactions which require special attention, from special_cases.txt
    - Purges some reactions which have problematic stoichiometries (e.g., the 
      many effective ATPases) 
    - Adds biomass sinks from biomass_components.txt
    - Adds external transport reactions from exchange_reactions.txt
    - Compartmentalizes the model per corn_compartments.txt
    - Adds intracellular transporters from corn_intracellular_transport.txt
      (producing a version of the model as a text file listing reactions, 
      their stoichiometries, the frames in the parent DB with which they 
      are associated, and their reversibilities, corn_full.txt)
    - Writes corn_fba.xml, an SBML (level 2 version 4) representation
      of the resulting model
    - Adds gene information to the reactions of the model (storing this in the 
      SBML Notes elements of the reactions, following the COBRA convention),
      iEB5204.xml
    - Builds a reduced version of the model, excluding as many
      reactions which either lack genes or lack an assigment to a
      pathway in CornCyc as possible, while still maintaining
      functionality, iEB2140.xml (note, this step does require
      pycyc, Pathway Tools in API mode, and a local copy of CornCyc). 
    - Converts this to a two-cell model representing interacting mesophyll and
      bundle sheath compartments, iEB2140x2.xml
